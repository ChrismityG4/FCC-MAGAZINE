# MAGAZINE â€“ RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN COURSE

This is the fifth notable build on this course utilising grid and column formatting.

The  use of column formatting seemed un-necessary as it has similar function to flex box formatting, however it was fun to learn and may come in useful at some future stage.

Thanks for reading!
